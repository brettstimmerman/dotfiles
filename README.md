# Brett's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many others like them, but these are mine.

## Installation

Initially:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brettstimmerman/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

Updating later:

```bash
git pull origin master
./bootstrap.sh
```

## Credits

[Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) invested way more
time than I did to make these dotfiles happen. I also borrowed a few bits from
[Ryan Grove](https://github.com/rgrove/dotfiles).
